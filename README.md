# 👨‍💻 About Me

I am enrolled in a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU) and currently an **IT Intern at Bayer**, working within the Crop Science area, with an emphasis on full-stack development (React, JavaScript), data analysis, and AI solutions built with Python. My work focuses on applying technology to support business processes, data-driven solutions, and scalable systems in a global corporate environment.

In 2024, I lived in Toronto for six months, where I studied English and worked in a factory, gaining hands-on international experience and improving my communication skills in a real-world environment.

I am motivated by using technology to improve efficiency, modernize processes, and deliver practical solutions with real-world impact. My interests include software development, systems integration, and applied artificial intelligence, with a focus on building reliable and scalable applications.
