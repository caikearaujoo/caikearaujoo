# 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Computer Science undergraduate at the Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU) and currently an **IT Intern at Bayer**, working within the **Crop Science** area. My work focuses on applying technology to support business processes, data-driven solutions, and scalable systems in a global corporate environment.

In 2024, I participated in an exchange program in **Toronto**, where I strengthened my English and gained international experience, reinforcing my goal of building a career in a global and multicultural setting.

I am highly motivated by using technology to improve efficiency, modernize processes, and create practical solutions with real-world impact. I am particularly interested in software development, systems integration, and building reliable applications that support large-scale operations.
